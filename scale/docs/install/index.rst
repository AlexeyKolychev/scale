The Scale team has been purposeful in minimizing the effort required to deploy the scheduler and supporting services.
With this goal in mind, Scale and all components are Docker containerized. While deployment of Scale within a standalone
installation of Apache Mesos is possible, this is strongly discouraged and unsupported. Deployment within Mesosphere
DC/OS provides a push-button path to a fully functional data processing cluster.
Our quick start instructions cover both the underlying DC/OS cluster deployment and installation of Scale.
