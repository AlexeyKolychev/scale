# Mesos Bindings

Creation of the Mesos bindings can be performed using the `make-mesos-egg` shell script. 3 parameters are expected that indicate the target platform,
the Mesos version and the output directory. Refer to the shell script header for further details. The following example command was used to build
the bindings used presently:

```
./make-mesos-egg centos7 1.6.1 bindings
```
