<a id="scale" class="anchor" href="#scale" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Scale</h1>

<p>Scale is a system that provides management of automated processing on a cluster of machines. It allows
users to define jobs, which can be any type of script or algorithm. These jobs run on ingested source
data and produce product files. The produced products can be disseminated to appropriate users and/or
used to evaluate the producing algorithm in terms of performance and accuracy.</p>

<h2>
<a id="mesos-and-nodes-" class="anchor" href="#mesos-and-nodes-" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Mesos and Nodes </h2>

<p>Scale runs across a cluster of networked machines (called nodes) that process the jobs. Scale utilizes
Apache Mesos, a free and open source project, for managing the available resources on the nodes. Mesos
informs Scale of available computing resources and Scale schedules jobs to run on those resources.</p>

<h2>
<a id="ingest-" class="anchor" href="#ingest-" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Ingest </h2>

<p>Scale ingests source files using a Scale component called Strike. Strike is a process that monitors an
ingest directory into which source data files are being copied. After a new source data file has been
ingested, Scale produces and places jobs on the queue depending on the type of the ingested file.
Many Strike processes can be run simultaneously, allowing Scale to monitor many different ingest directories.</p>

<h2>
<a id="jobs-" class="anchor" href="#jobs-" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Jobs </h2>

<p>Scale creates jobs based on its known job types. A job type defines key characteristics about an algorithm
that Scale needs to know in order to run it (what command to run, the algorithm.s inputs and outputs, etc.)
Job types are labeled with versions, allowing Scale to run multiple versions of the same algorithm. Jobs may
be created automatically due to an event, such as the ingest of a particular type of source data file, or
they may be created manually by a user. Jobs that need to be executed are placed onto and prioritized within
a queue before being scheduled onto an available node. When multiple jobs need to be run in a serial or parallel
sequence, a recipe can be created that defines the job workflow.</p>

<h2>
<a id="products-" class="anchor" href="#products-" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Products </h2>

<p>Jobs can produce products as a result of their successful execution. Products may be disseminated to users
or used to analyze and improve the algorithms that produced them. Scale allows the creation of different
workspaces. A workspace defines a separate location for storing source or product files. When a job is created,
it is given a workspace to use for storing its results, allowing a user to control whether the job.s results
are available to a wider audience or are restricted to a private workspace for the user's own use.</p>

<a id="quick-start" class="anchor" href="#quick-start" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Quick Start</h1>

<p>We've provided a vagrant and ansible setup to get you going quickly. Make sure vagrant, virtualbox, and ansible are installed then.</p>

<pre><code>cd vagrant
vagrant up
</code></pre>

<p>This will download a centos7 base image and start 2 virtual machines, a master and a slave. You can add additional slaves by editing <code>Vagrantfile</code> and adding them to the <code>HOSTS</code> and <code>mesos-slaves</code> sections before doing the <code>vagrant up</code>. Ansible will be used to push the configuration out and can take a while to run. You make need to modify <code>ansible/group_vars/all</code> or <code>ansible/vagrant.yml</code> if you need to specify a local docker index, etc.</p>
